Defacto segregation: SGA raps cheerleaders’ policy

Student Government Association Cabinet has accused the cheerleaders of de facto segregation and discrimination in a brief submitted yesterday to the judiciary office. Ray Ferrara, SGA treasurer and co-author of the brief, said the brief was “prepared to insure that the defacto segregation that now exists will eventually be corrected.” According to Ferrara, if the court rules in favor of the brief, the cheerleaders will be reorganized to be more representa­tive of the student body. The Cabinet brief against the cheerleaders contains four points of argument;
• The cheerleaders are not a recognized campus organization,
• the most recent cheer leading tryouts showed evidence of defacto segregation and discrimi­nation,
• the cheerleaders maintain that black cheerleaders would provide additional financial burden and inconvenience because the squad could no longer stay in sorority and fraternity houses at southern schools during away games and
• the cheerleaders stated at a fall meeting of the Cabinet that “black women’s movements are too fluid and selection of black women would not maintain con­tinuity within the squad.”
According to the brief, the cheerleaders should not be permitted to use the name of the University or represent the students because they are not a recognized student activity.
Currently, the cheerleaders are not recognized by SGA because they fail to comply with the requirement that student groups must have a constitution.
However, according to Ferrara, SGA "underwrites" the activities of the cheerleaders, and provides them with funds.
SGA President Jerry Fleischer said last night that SGA will withhold cheerleader funds from
now on because they are not a recognized student activity.
"We never bothered to check in the fall whether the cheerleaders were recognized," he explained. "They’ve been on campus so long."
Further, the University’s General and Academic Rules state that, "No organization may represent the University without the approval of the SGA and the Faculty Senate Committee on Student Activities."
Besides denying the cheerleaders the right to represent the University, the brief also calls for denying the funds on the grounds that they violate the University policy declarations on
discrimination.
The brief also maintains that since the cheerleaders are guilty of "clearly discriminatory” selection, they may be cut off from state funds.
"The state says that there will be no discrimination and according to the non-dlscriminatory policy of the Faculty Senate and the University president, the funds cannot be used where discrimination exists," Ferrara explained.
